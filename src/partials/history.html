        The history of Bose Corporation began with disappointment. In 1956, MIT
        graduate student Amar Bose bought one of the best stereo systems at the
        time for his home. After a few minutes of listening to the audio
        recording, his bewilderment turned to disappointment.

      <p class="history__text">
        From Amar's point of view, the sound was so flat and unnatural that it
        was better not to listen to the music at all than to listen to it in
        such a distorted form.

        Bose's frustration grew into a firm determination to build audio
        equipments that would reproduce sound with impeccable accuracy and
